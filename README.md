## üß† Core Cognitive Techniques & Advanced Reasoning

### üîó Chain of Abstraction Reasoning

**Cognitive Architect's signature feature**: A revolutionary 6-layer abstraction system that transforms concrete thoughts into theoretical frameworks, enabling unprecedented depth of analysis.

```json
"abstractions": {
  "0": "Concrete elements: React, TypeScript, Performance",     // Raw facts & entities
  "1": "Performance optimization implications identified",       // Immediate cause-effect
  "2": "Component architecture patterns detected",              // Structural relationships  
  "3": "React best practices principles",                       // Governing rules
  "4": "Frontend architecture methodology",                     // Abstract methodologies
  "5": "Modern web development framework"                       // Theoretical frameworks
}
```

**How it works**: Each thought is automatically analyzed across all 6 abstraction levels, creating a complete cognitive map from concrete details to high-level theoretical understanding.

### üß© Advanced Pattern Recognition Engine
